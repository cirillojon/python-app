# Simple Python App

This is a simple Python app I am building to learn how to use python to create applications

The app currently includes three simple games: Number Guessing Game, Rock Paper Scissors, and Coin Toss.

Coin toss currently features a rudimentary betting system.

## Requirements

- Tkinter

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-apps.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd python-apps`
3. Run the app: `python app.py`
